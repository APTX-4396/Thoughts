I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emporor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible-Jew, Gentile-black man-white.

We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness-not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.

The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls - has barricaded the world with hate - has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in man, cries for universal brotherhood- for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughtout the word- millions of despairing men, women and little children- victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say 'Don't despair'. This misery that is now upon us is but the passing the greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, the dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. As so long men die, liberty will never perish.

Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to the brutes- men who despise you and enslave you-who regiment your lives -tell you what to do-what to think and what to feel! Who drill you-diet you-treat you like cattle, use you as a cannon fodder. Don't give youselves to these unnatural men- machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machine! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate, only the unloved hate- the unloved and the unnatural!

Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the seventeenth chapter of St Luke, it is written the kingdom of the God is within man not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power - the power to create machine- the power to create hapiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful - to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new word - a decent word that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security.

By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free this word - todo away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reson - a world where science and progress will lead to all men's hapiness. Soldiers, int the name of democracy, let us unite!

Hannah, can you hear me? wherever you are, look up Hannah. The clouds are lifting! The sun is breaking through! We are coming out of the darkness into light. We are coming into a new world - a kindlier world, where men will rise above their hate, their greed and their brutality. Look up, Hunnah! The soul of men has been given wings and at least he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow - into the light of hope, into the future, the glorious future that belongs to you, to me, and to all of us. Look up, Hannah......Look up!





卓别林因为这部电影被德国驻美大使以及美国法西斯组织联合打压  
而影片中查理·卓别林想象出来的集中营在真正的集中营面前根本不值一提 现实往往比艺术更加荒诞  
全片最后的演讲足以载入电影的史册，甚至记录在人类文明的历史上，因为在当时的美国还有一个保持着人性的人敢于用自己的作品来为人民发声（虽然没人看，但是为了防杠，说明一下卓别林爵士是英国人）  
不管是怎样的身份，怎样的地位，在“人民”这个头衔之下，所有人都应当是平等的，无论种族、血统、权力与金钱，都是普普通通的“人民”  
而有一些“人民”拿着枪杆子，却做着背弃人民的事，只会让人民感到心寒的同时觉得恶心。  
但他们的枪杆子实际上属于人民。  

道听途说的冷知识：（我个人无法保证真假）  
元首看了一遍大独裁者之后第二天面无表情的二刷。也有传闻说元首是卓别林的粉丝，不知道传闻的真假，也不知道那个疯子看了电影后的真实心情如何。
