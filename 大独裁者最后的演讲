I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emporor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible-Jew, Gentile-black man-white.

We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's hapiness-not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this word there is room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.
